# 2) Generate patch
PROMPT = f"""
Based on this PLAN, generate a minimal patch to start implementing.
Rules:
- Keep diff small (â‰¤ ~100 lines).
- If creating files, include full content.
- Focus on scaffolding first (folders, basic code).
- Use Python or JSON for n8n flow exports when relevant.
PLAN:
{plan}

Output format:
```patch
<unified diff or indicate file writes clearly>
